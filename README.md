# Typescript_Design_Patterns
This repository contains a game created in Typescript to prove my competencies with the observer's, singleton, strategy and polymorphism patterns for my Programming 8 class.

This project was made in under 4/5 hours (which was a requirement) and contains an additional UML design. 
I've been graded a 8.6/10 for this project.
